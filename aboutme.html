        Hey, gorgeous human! Arko here. <br /><br />
        👋 Welcome to this ephemeral online residence! Very kind of you to stop
        by. While design is omnipresent, I'm not. I'm currently based out of 📍
        Bangalore, India. <br /><br />
        To give you an idea about the kind of design that I dabble in, I'm into
        Interface, Experience & Graphic design. If you think about it, design is
        what makes life, life. Apart from design, I write code too. Graduated in
        2019 from PES University, Bangalore with a degree in Computer Science &
        Engineering.
