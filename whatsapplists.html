        Improved interactivity in WhatsApp messaging
      </div>
      <div class="my-4 sm:my-8 mb-14 mx-8 sm:mx-24 text-justify text-sm">
        As part of the Service & User Experience Design learning unit (by John
        Praveen Ganta and Syed Gowhar Andrabi) of the Design & Identity studio,
        we explored tools and methods to make the services we use, more usable,
        easy, and desirable.
        <br /><br />
        One project that I worked on involved an attempt at improving
        interactivity in WhatsApp messaging. The idea was to introduce a flavour
        of elevated interactivity in an attempt to provide an increased sense of
        convenience. We envisioned a feature that would allow users to exchange
        bi-directional, editable lists within WhatsApp. Bi-directionality would
        ensure that an item in the list that has been checked off one end shows
        as checked-off on the other end too.
        <br /><br />
        Let's go through a scenario to understand why the aforementioned
        functionality might be helpful.
        <br /><br />
        <div class="flex flex-col sm:flex-row items-center">
          <div class="w-full sm:w-1/2 p-4 sm:p-8">
            <div class="text-sm py-4 text-gray-600">
              I narrate a frequently occuring event from my personal life here —
              my mother requests me to buy grocery from the store, on my way
              back home from work. She would send the list of items to me as a
              normal WhatsApp text message. Any items that she would forget, she
              would send them as separate messages (or as replies to her first
              message).
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="w-full sm:w-1/2">
            <img

            />
          </div>
        </div>
        <br /><br />
        The following carousel contains the floor plan of the store from which I
        need to buy the groceries. The letters indicate the items from my mum's
        message as they're spread across the store.

        So, what's the issue here?
        <br /><br />
        <img class="w-full" src="./images/wa-issues.jpg" alt="..." />
        <br /><br />
        Instead ...
        <br /><br />
        <img class="w-full" src="./images/wa-instead.jpg" alt="..." />
        <br /><br />
        This thought was born out of a personal need, to begin with. Upon
        conversations with people, we gauged that others had a similar need too.
        Armed with this rudimentary validation, we went about brainstorming
        several flows based on User Stories that we had developed. User Stories
        are short, specific, and goal-oriented, collaborative design tools. They
        assume the structure of a statement with three key parts - As a
        <b><i>{user}</i></b
        >, I would like <b><i>{to accomplish an action}</i></b>
        <b><i>{to achieve a certain goal}</i></b
        >. <br /><br />
        Given the short duration, we went through two rounds of iterations and
        feedback from very limited (and probably biased) user testing; before
        prototyping one flow in high-fidelity. <br /><br /><br />
