        This website is an attempt to make my work available to all those who
        were not able to engage with my work on the day of the gallery walk (14
        May 2022). The site annotates and delves into the various explorations
        that I undertook over the course of five months. The explorations have
        spanned both the physical and the digital realms. Since their inception,
        a lot of these works and ideas have encountered several minds on their
        way to execution. I shall name these co-designers at appropriate
        junctures. I wish to unpack projects under the broad theme of
        <b
          ><i
            >storytelling through the agencies of humour, play, and poetry
            (rhyme)</i
          ></b
        >. As will be evident, poetry introduces an aspect of playfulness to the
        mix. There are several questions around art, design, the practice of
        making, etc. that I try to address throughout this website.<br /><br />
        To briefly lay out the timeline, all works, and concepts in this
        document were created at some point during a 5-month period - January
        through May of 2022. I present a total of seven pieces of work. Some of
        them possess a strand of play in their DNA. Some of them explore the
        power of language, via poetry, to accentuate the playfulness and thus
        elicit joy. It is interesting to note, though, that poetry was something
        that I noticed while sifting through my body of work. While I’ve always
        enjoyed the rhythm associated with rhyme, I hadn’t necessarily thought
        of its ability to elicit emotions. This discovery ties in well with my
        intial line of inquiry of ‘The Art of Eliciting Emotions’. There are
        questions that evolved while annotating the works that reside on this
        site, which I intend to bring up under the respective works.

        I'd love to hear from you about thoughts that stuck with you as you
        interacted with the work here. Or if I might've missed out on obvious
        (or not so obvious) critical connections, pray tell! You can reach out
        to me via email —
