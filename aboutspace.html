        This website reflects the various explorations that I undertook over the
        course of five months. The explorations have spanned both the physical
        and the digital realms. Since their inception, a lot of these works and
        ideas have encountered several minds on their way to execution. I shall
        name these co-designers at appropriate junctures. I wish to unpack
        projects under two broad themes - one being the influence and impact of
        poetry on the playfulness of an idea/artifact, and the other being
        designing effective & accessible digital products. As will be evident,
        poetry introduces an aspect of playfulness to the mix. I wish to, then,
        address the relationship between play and joy. Two projects under the
        latter theme are my experiences with trying to understand user behavior
        encompassing digital products. <br /><br />
        To briefly lay out the timeline, all works, and concepts in this
        document were created at some point during a 5-month period - January
        through May of 2022. I wish to classify all work under two broad
        thematic groups; they're titled <b><i>'Of Poetry & Play — Building joyful
        experiences'</b></i> and <b><i>'Of Future Possibilities — Designing effective and
        accessible digital products'</b></i>. The first thematic group involves five
        pieces of work. All of them possess a strand of play in their DNA. Some
        of them explore the power of language, via poetry, to accentuate the
        playfulness and thus elicit joy. The second thematic group deals with
        two projects. They are digital products that have been heavily informed
        by an understanding of user behaviour and conversations with actual
        consumers of the product. They highlight my attempt at understanding
        accessibility and its effect on the future of digital design. It is
        interesting to note, though, that poetry was something that I noticed
        while sifting through my body of work. While I’ve always enjoyed the
        rhythm associated with rhyme, I hadn’t necessarily thought of its
        ability to elicit emotions. This discovery ties in well with my intial
        line of inquiry of ‘The Art of Eliciting Emotions’. There are questions
        that evolved while annotating material on this website, which I intend
        to bring up in subsequent sections.
